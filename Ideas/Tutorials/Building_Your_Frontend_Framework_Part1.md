Things about the tutorial before you begin

	*This could easily be called your frontend framework
	*So I want to cover the fact that there are other premade frontend frameworks that are standard in UI design and development
		*These frameworks are great for prototyping and building production ready sites very quickly
	*So why wouldn't we just start with these premade tried and tested frameworks versuses building our own?
		* In most cases we would start out with skeleton or bootstrap or foundation. But we're not, by building things our self, we're forcing ourselves to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Who knows, by the time we're finish you may want to just use your framework. Espcially since you're already familar with it. 

This tut is going to be part of a series that's aimed to teach total beginners the basics and best practices of UI design and development
