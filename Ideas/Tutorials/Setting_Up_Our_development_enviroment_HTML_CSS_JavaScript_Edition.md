Excerpt:   

Every Scientist has a lab so they can conduct their experitments in a controlled enviroment. For Developers we call our lab our devlopment enviroment. This enviroment at it's basic of forms should include:

	1. A machine (computer, laptop, tablet, or phone)so we can write code on.

	2. A place where you can sit, stand, and/or float while you write code.
	
	3. An operating System AKA OS like windows, Mac OSX, Ubuntu, ect
	
	4. A web browser like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer Aka IE, aka the browser all developers aviod dealing with.
	
	5. A text editor so we can write and edit our code.
	
	6. Some software that'll allow us to run our code on our local machine so we can see visually what we've done.
	
	7. Last and certianly not least, whatever other tools you may find wether it be hardware or software that'll help get the job done.	
	
Our development enviroment is very important for our present and future projects. As a quick side note, what we have in our development is totally dependent on what kind of project we're working on tools. Different projects call for different tools at times to get the job done. But, more on that later when we've covered some basic things first. 

Good behavior starts at home, at least that's what me teachers use to tell me. Same is true for our projects we'll be developing. The future of our apps, programs, and/or websites are trully dependent on how well we treat  them at home on our local development enviroment.

We all have our own preferences when it comes to things, and I have my own preferences when it comes to setting up my development enviroment. I certain tools that know work well with certian projects and certain tools I know have the patience for when they magically start malfucntioning. So lets get to it.
