Excerpt:

So I at first I was thinking of a series of tech oriented books that'll be lets say about scala. Well, let me back track. I think the best way to learn is to do project based tutorial and so forth. So lets take a project like creating an online voting app for conferences. This app is honestly based on what Ben from thoughtbot said how conferences should do their CPF (I think), and what Ben wants, ben gets. With this in mind we appoarch the project as a non-techinal single founder, with no design or code skills at all. We want an MVP of this in one week. So we'll start with the UI/UX planning, visual design, UI development as the first part of the series of the book. 

In the second part of the book series we'll focus on the backend development of our project. That's were we'll worry about those questions like what language will we right this in and what frameworks should we use and so forth.

The third and final book of the series we'll focus on deployment, mantaince, and performance of the app. And, dependent on how well the series does I would follow it up with a book on how to extend and scale the app and also how I would market it.

I want the first part the UI/UX, visual design, and frontend development book to have all of the assets used in the book. I want it to be:

* Well documented

* Easy to download 

* I want the assets themselves to be of great quality

* And other stuff I just can't think of it right now

With all of this said, the original thought was to release all three books of the series in one month. But honestly, I wouldn't have the time to actually write good quality books with examples that made sense and so forth. Plus I would feel rushed like all the time. So I've decided to release one book Tech book a month and really focus on providing great content to the readers. But I still do want to release 3 books a month. I think one should be about business while the other deals with life. The life book could be about all sorts things that effect a Man, Woman or whatever. I want the book about life to be super flexible and cool. 

The business book will focus on marketing, managing, and just your ups and downs of making things happen.
