Excerpt:   

I'd like to keep notes about projects, blog post ideas, tut ideas,  conference talk ideas, questions for interviews, and book draft ideas.

So the ambitous break down would be like:

* 3 books a month

* 4 interviews a week

* 5 blog posts a week

* 3 tuts a week

* 1 conference talk

* 1 Meetup talk

I want most of my matieral to be geared towards beginners and those non-techinal founder types. I think that when people think of learning these technologies they look at them as the black magic boxes. So I want to ease them into it.
