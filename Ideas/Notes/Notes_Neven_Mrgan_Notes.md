Excerpt:   

* Neven spends time hashing out his thoughts by bouncing ideas off his self and teammates. This takes place before he even touches Photoshop.
* Neven doesn't start projects off with sketches. He starts where the user will spend 90% of their time at. Everything else comes from that 90%.
* Figure out the use cases.
* Use colors, fonts, sizes, or effects to add importancte to an item on your page.
* Don't ever use Lorem text or grey boxes in your projects agian. They take away the life of your design project.
* Skala is an app to look into.
* Appoarch your design project by starting out with whats abosolutely needed first. Things like color, fonts, and so forth come after you figure out what the structure and rythm will be.
